					Thank you Alpha Learning for helping me pass my CFA Level 1 exam, your style of teaching and detailed knowledge of the curriculum really helped me. I was previously using Youtube videos, additional condensed notes, and the text book but found that nothing was working to help me fully understand the material. This is when I called Alpha Learning for that extra help I could not get from learning by myself. She was able to easily explain to me concepts that I was struggling with and I found it very easy to meet up with her. I would highly recommend getting a tutor to help you when you are struggling with the material or questions to really give you that extra amount of knowledge and be able to ask questions so you understand better. The time I spent with Alpha Learning was well worth it considering it took me much longer to try to understand difficult concepts on my own. Highly recommended!&nbsp&nbsp
